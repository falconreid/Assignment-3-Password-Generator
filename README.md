# Assignment-3-Password-Generator

Assignment was to create a script that generates random password with letters, numbers and special characters.

I created a password generator that generates random letters, numbers and special characters.

First I thought to create variables for each string. That proved unneccessary as I forked a snippet from stack overflow which was more efficient for the task.

Then I created prompts for each string/array to determine if the user wanted certain characters included - or not included.

I created a while statement/loop to make sure that the expected length of the password was the correct length.

I created a while statement to make sure that the user requested at least 1 set of characters. If they did not, it requires them to.

Then I tied the randomization function into the output function

I changed the css a little to create a more appealling look. Though I admit I'm still stumped why the css doesn't apply until after the data has been collected.
